// If you try printing the below you would see "[object Object]"" which is not that useful.
// Instead, you can click "Inspect it" to see the result in the JavaScript console where you can look inside the object.
// That result is not displayed in the editor window -- it is only displayed in the console.

// To open the console in various browsers, see:
// https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-do-i-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers
// In most browsers, you can right-click on part of the web page and pick "Inspect" from the popup menu there
// and then when the developer tools open, pick the console tab.

// You can also try selecting just parts of the object (like the array) and use "Inspect It" or "Print it".
